error[E0597]: `a` does not live long enough

   |            ----------------   ^^ borrowed value does not live long enough
   |            |
   |            type annotation requires that `a` is borrowed for `'static`
LL | }
   | - `a` dropped here while still borrowed
   |
help: you can remove unnecessary lifetime annotations here
